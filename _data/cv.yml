   summary: Physically the smallest of the Turtles and the least mature. Mikey is easily distracted and enthusiastic about... well, pretty much everything. He's also extremely creative.

He's a social mutant and more than the others, pines to be part of the real world.

He may have the most raw talent of the four, but he does not seem to have the skill to develop it.
